This Unity 3D project is a game designed to test the player's reflexes. The goal of the game is to click and destroy objects that are randomly tossed in the air before they can fall off the screen
To create this game, I used Unity's physics engine to randomly instantiate objects, such as cubes or spheres, at random positions above a ground plane and applying random upward force to the objects. I also created a script that detects mouse clicks and checks if the click is over a tossed object. If it is, the object is destroyed and the player's score increases.
The goal of the game is to click and destroy objects that are randomly tossed in the air before they can fall off the screen.
Objects will randomly appear at different positions above the ground plane.
Use your mouse to click on the objects to destroy them.
Your score will increase each time you successfully click and destroy an object.
If an object falls off the screen, your score will decrease.
The game is over when the time runs out, try to get the highest score possible.
The player's current score is displayed on the top of the screen.
Good luck and have fun!
